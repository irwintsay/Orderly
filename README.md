# Order.ly

Welcome to Order.ly, a full stack point of sales waiter application built with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and MaterializeCSS.

The goal of this project was to create a mobile friendly, Point-of-Sale application for Waiters/Hosts. Design and styling took a backseat to making functionality easy to use on a small device such as a smartphone or tablet.

### Prototyping

Once the project was assigned, I spent the majority of the first day brainstorming and white boarding the ERD for what would eventually become the structure for my PostgreSQL database. This process actually required me to think about how my application would look and function, because it would have implications on how I would store and display data.

Once I had wrapped my mind around the ERD for my application, I started hand-drawing wireframes for what my application would eventually look like.
